			For the past years, many qualitative studies rely on lived experiences as a basis, especially those
 involving phenomenological reflection due to the ‘intelligibility’ both in its beginning and ending. This essentially comes from our 
awareness of it and its evaluative aspect, which as well features effective use in better understanding the human experience and 
other phenomena. As we focus on the fundamentality of lived experiences, personal insights and the public side of social are gained 
and interlinked. This tends to make it specially relevant to marginalized groups which families of EJK victims seemed to belong. 
The lived experiences of these people in accord with the issue regarding EJK might highly reflect and give rise to the meaning 
of the incidents themselves. This as well might then shed light to the social issue, and give voice to its victims.

			<div class="content">
			<font face="Arial" size="4">
			
  			<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Extrajudicial killings (EJK) have been a persistent global issue since the  early 1940s 
and  result  in the formulation  of  many  local  and  international  laws  that  aim  to  fully  eradicate  it (Pangilinan,  2012;  Parreño,  2011;  
&  Henckaerts,  2005). However, its cases continue to grow  and it was reported to show an increase in its incidence around the world. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Philippines, EJK remains the root of the continued international criticisms and started to become rampant due to the imposition of 
Martial Law. It had been  used as a counterinsurgency  strategy of the government and was allowed during the time of Arroyo and Aquino. 
It is also tolerated by Aquino’s successor, Rodrigo Duterte after a few months of being elected as a president.

			<div class="content">
			<font face="Arial" size="4">
  			<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
EJK seemed to be directed against the rampant illegal drug use in the country as for the 
present administration. In fact, as of January 9, 2017, a total of 4,146 cases of drug-related killings occurred outside police operations 
and 3, 271 of them were categorized as “deaths under investigation” (Bueza, 2016).  
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This social issue seems to be viewed in two lenses of which it is perceived to be victim-centered and extended beyond the victims, 
having an immeasurable impact on their families. These aid a primary  focus  on  the  killed  victims  and  their  moral status  since  
they  were  involved  in  illegal  drugs.  It  debates  whether  the  victim  deserves condemnation  or  sympathy (Saunar,  2014;  Casiño,  
2016;  Morallo,  2017).

			</p></font>
			</div>
<br>
			<button class="collapsible">The Impact of Drug-Related EJK on Victim’s Families</button>
			<div class="content">
			<font face="Arial" size="4">
  			<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As for the cases of the families of victims subjected to drug-related EJK, the   available   studies consistently  focused upon only three 
elements that constitute their experiences as a result of the  loss  of  their  family  members.  These  are  legal  obstacles,  economic  
difficulties  and violation of emotional integrity (Clarke, 2016).
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The families of EJK victims experienced difficulties in investigation and prosecution of which the said issue is commonly seen in the 
apparent poor policing and the lack of cooperation and reluctance to testify on the part of the witnesses (Human Rights Watch,  2007;  
Human  Rights  Watch,  2011;  Ateneo  Human  Rights  Center,  2017;Amnesty International, 2017; Pangilinan, 2012). It also lacks 
formality, legislated and clear definition which makes it harder for prosecutors to solve and close cases due to an undefined scope of 
what kinds of killing constitute such. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since  EJK  victims  are  often  identified  as  the  breadwinners  of  their  families,  their death  marked  a  greater  economic  suffering  
experienced  by  the  families  left  behind  (Center for Trade Union and Human Rights, 2011). It adversely affected their overall standard
 of living and resulted in diminished  household  income  thereby  having a significant  impact  on household budgeting and a family’s quality
 of life (Corden & Hirst, 2013). 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Given  the  fact  that  EJK often  ends  unresolved,  the  recovery  of  families  from  the  death  of  a  family  member  is  made more  
difficult. It was found that even their emotional integrity was negatively affected having the loss  of  a  family  member  who  was  killed  
without  due  process  of  law. To sum  it  up,  EJK  brought  feelings  of  hopelessness,  prolonged  grief  and  fear  to  the  families  of 
victims.
